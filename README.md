In a world where criminals adapt to technology, law enforcement must evolve faster. Traditional methods—fingerprint analysis, eyewitness testimonies, and manual suspect tracking—are no longer sufficient in addressing modern challenges.

This study explores the role of Machine Learning (ML) and Face Recognition in transforming criminal identification. By leveraging AI-driven algorithms, these systems can scan and analyze facial features with high precision, match suspects in real-time against global databases, and enhance surveillance with predictive crime detection.
Unlike conventional approaches, ML-based face recognition processes vast amounts of data in seconds, ensuring greater accuracy while minimizing human error
